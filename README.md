# 📚 Linked List

A **linked list** is a fundamental data structure used in computer science to store collections of elements. Each element, known as a **node**, contains two parts: the **data** and a **reference** (or link) to the next node, forming a chain-like structure.

## 🧩 Types of Linked Lists

### 1. Singly Linked List
- 🔗 Each node points to the next node.
- 🔄 Allows traversal in one direction.

### 2. Doubly Linked List
- 🔗 Each node points to both the next and the previous node.
- 🔄 Allows traversal in both directions.

### 3. Circular Linked List
- 🔄 The last node links back to the first node, forming a loop.
- 🔁 Can be either singly or doubly linked.

## 🌟 Advantages
- ⚡ Efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays.
- 📏 Dynamic size.

## ⚠️ Disadvantages
- 🐌 Slower access to elements by index due to the need to traverse the list from the beginning.
